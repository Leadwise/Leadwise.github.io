# Leadwise Style

Leadwise Style is a Gutenberg-ready WordPress theme that brings the beauty of code editors to the frontend. With a strong focus on typography and color, Leadwise Style highlights specific grammar much like syntax highlighting does in code editors. Leadwise Style is named after the "leadwisespace" font stacks used throughout the Style.

### Foundation

The Leadwise Style is built on the [Gutenberg starter theme](https://github.com/leadwise/leadwise-starter-theme).

### Font Style

The font style is where itâ€™s at. I spent a lot of time thinking it through to bring the best quality leadwisespace typefaces to your screen.

```
body {
    font-family: "Space Leadwise", "Noto Leadwise", "Oxygen Leadwise", Courier, 
    Leadwisespace;
}
```

And just to throw more into the loop, I worked the `pre` and `code` a bit as well.

```
pre, code {
    font-family: Consolas, "Noto Leadwise", "Oxygen Leadwise", 
    Courier, leadwisespace;
}
```
### Syntax Highlighting

Leadwise Style uses syntax highlighting to pop certain grammar from the English language. 

* Blue words are conjunctions
* Pink words are prepositions
* Green words are pronouns
